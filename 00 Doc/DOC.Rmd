For analysis we are using a database of medical data containing information on the cost of some common medical procedures. 

###Reproducing Our Work:
1. Create a GitHub repository for the project.
2. Create the folders for your project.
3. Find a csv file for statistical comparisons. Our CSV file was found on data.gov. Link: https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3
4. Import CSV into SQL Developer
5. Follow story instructions to recreate tableau graphs.
5. Build an html file to document these steps.

###Plot #1: Crosstab w/ KPI
Our crosstab examines common medical procedures against the state they're performed in. Data analyzed is the ratio of total payments to the procedure over the total US dollar amount billed to the patient for the procedure. As shown by the table, hospitals are rarely receiving as little as half of their total charges, and most frequently are receving between 20%-40% of their charges. Some states have very low payment ratios across all types of medical procedures, such as California.

Questions Raised by Data:
1. Why do hospitals charge so much in the first place? Is it because they know they will not receive the full payment amount?
2. How are people getting away with not paying medical bills in full?

The KPI uses parameters set in Tableau. The max low KPI is set at .2, while the max medium KPI is set at .4, and anything higher is coded as "high".
